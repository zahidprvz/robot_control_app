# Flutter Robot Control App

## Description
This Flutter application allows you to control a self-balancing robot using your mobile device. The app communicates with an ESP8266 microcontroller connected to the robot's hardware, enabling you to send commands for movement and tilt control.

## Features
- **Real-time Tilt Control**: Utilize your mobile device's accelerometer to control the robot's tilt and movement.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple and user-friendly interface for seamless control.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust various parameters such as PID constants and motor control settings.
- **Status Monitoring**: Monitor the robot's status and sensor data in real-time.

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter IDE or editor.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running `flutter pub get` in the terminal.
4. Connect your mobile device to your computer and run the app using `flutter run`.

## Usage
1. **Connect to the Robot**: Make sure your mobile device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the ESP8266 microcontroller.
2. **Launch the App**: Open the app on your mobile device.
3. **Calibrate Sensors**: If required, calibrate the accelerometer and gyro sensors for accurate tilt control.
4. **Control Movement**: Tilt your device forward, backward, left, or right to control the robot's movement.
5. **Adjust Settings**: Customize PID constants and motor control settings as needed for optimal performance.
6. **Monitor Status**: Keep an eye on the robot's status and sensor data displayed on the app interface.
